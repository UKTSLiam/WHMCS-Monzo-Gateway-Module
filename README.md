# WHMCS-Monzo-Gateway-Module
A module to redirect users to the monzo.me send money system.

Monzo is a growing platform that is used mostly in the UK for transactions and account holding just like banks such as Natwest however it's all app based.

Monzo offers a side service called Monzo.me that allows people to pay into someone's Monzo account and with this feature in mind the script provided will redirect users to the monzo.me with the correct amount and invoice id to be paid into your account.

Note: This currently cannot do callbacks due to how Monzo.me works and manual confirmation will be needed.
